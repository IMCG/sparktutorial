      <h3>What's Spark?</h3>

<p>Big data and data science are enabled by scalable, distributed processing frameworks that allow organizations to analyze petabytes of data on large commodity clusters. MapReduce (especially the <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a> open-source implementation) is the first, and perhaps most famous, of these frameworks. What's next? Well, Spark is (one) answer.</p>

      <h3>What's this tutorial about?</h3>

<p>This is a two-and-a-half day tutorial on the distributed programming framework <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Apache Spark</a>.</p>

<p>The class will include introductions to the many Spark features, case studies from current users, best practices for deployment and tuning, future development plans, and hands-on exercises.</p> 

<p>In addition, there will be ample time to mingle and network with other big data and data science enthusiasts in the metro DC area.</p>

      <h3>When? Where?</h3>

<p>This tutorial is being organized by <a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jimmylin/">Jimmy Lin</a> and jointly hosted by the <a href="http://ischool.umd.edu/">iSchool</a> and <a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/">Institute for Advanced Computer Studies</a> at the <a href="http://www.umd.edu/">University of Maryland</a>. The tutorial will be led by Paco Nathan and Reza Zadeh.</p>

<p>The event will take place from October 20 (Monday) to 22 (Wednesday) in the <a href="http://www.lib.umd.edu/mckeldin/specialevents/info">Special Events Room</a> in the McKeldin Library on the University of Maryland campus (actual room number is 6137). The tutorial will run all day Monday, all day Tuesday, and end at noon on Wednesday. The event is free for University of Maryland students and open to the general public for a nominal registration fee.</p>

<p>If you are a University of Maryland student, register <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lKX0DmgGAf_2WwREmY8dR9XXonikFWYVkJKpI1BZmAk/viewform?usp=send_form">here</a></b>. You <b>must</b> use a <code>umd.edu</code> email address and your registration is is not complete until you get an email confirmation from us.</p>

<p>Members of the general public are also welcome, although we request a nominal $35 registration fee. Please use <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/spark-tutorial-tickets-449598762">this Eventbrite page</a> to register. The registration fee will go towards the venue and keeping everyone caffeinated.</p>

<p><i>Update:</i> Due to overwhelming demand, we've filled available capacity. We're currently investigating the possibility of opening up more seats, but are constrained by the size of the venue. If you remain interested, please sign up for the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-sZOo4YS_BU0OznL6VDiKRxJD9Q3A6N5wEz6oi8Z0ZQ/viewform?usp=send_form">wait list</a> and we'll contact you if more seats become available or if we schedule another tutorial in the near future.</p>

<h3>Logistics</h3>

<p>Maps of the University of Maryland can be found <a href="http://www.umd.edu/CampusMaps/campus_maps.cfm">here</a>. McKeldin Library is at one end of the mall that runs across the center of campus; it looks like <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:UMD_Mckeldin_Fountain.JPG">this</a> and it's pretty hard to miss. Take the elevators up to the 6th floor to room 6137.</p>

<p>To find parking on campus, check out <a href="http://www.transportation.umd.edu/maps&apps.html">this link</a>. Just a warning, allow ample time getting <i>onto</i> campus in the morning, especially if you arrive on the hour. Students getting to classes can clog up traffic, and it's not rare to sit at an intersection for more than ten minutes waiting for students to stream by.</p>

<p>Yes, we will be providing wireless access and coffee, probably the two most important ingredients to a successful technology tutorial. The power outlet situation, however, is a bit iffy. The room we are in does not have outlets at the seats, although there are outlets along the walls. Make sure your laptop is charged! Also, if you have a power strip conveniently lying around, please bring so we can share...</p>

<p>The tutorial will start at 10am <i>sharp</i>, but doors open at 9am... we'll be around, and you're welcome to stop by and mingle.</p>

<h3>Preparations</h3>

<p>The first two days of the tutorial will be presented at the level of a CS freshman. We expect the attendee to have some programming experience in Python, Java, or Scala.</p>

<p>Throughout the class, there will be hands-on exercises. You are expected to bring your own laptop for those, with the minimum system requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>reasonably current hardware, at least 2 GB memory</li>
<li>MacOSX, Windows, Linux &mdash; all work fine</li>
<li>make sure you don't have corporate security controls that prevent use of the network
<li>Java JDK 6, 7, or 8 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">installed</a></li>
<li>Python 2.7 <a target="_blank" href="http://continuum.io/downloads">installed</a></li>
<li>do not install Spark with Homebrew or Cygwin</li>
<li>we will provide USB sticks with the necessary data + code</li>

</ul>

<p>If you're eager to get started, look through resources <a href="http://databricks.com/spark-training-resources">here</a>.</p>

<p>The third (half day) of the tutorial will be presented at the level of a CS graduate student, focusing specifically on research on or with Spark.</p>
